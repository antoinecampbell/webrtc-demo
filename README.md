Playing around with WebRTC

This diagram from the WebRTC docs closely resembles what this application
is doing. This application does not use a TURN server, so there's a chance
two clients will be unable to connect. I'm currently using Google's public
STUN servers which are for development. So far seems to work fine when the two
clients are on the same network.
